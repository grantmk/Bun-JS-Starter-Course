# bun-js-starter-course-section-2 (A Simple Bun Server - Exploring the API)

This is companion code for Section 2 of my bun JS course which you can find at:  https://iamdev.net/courses/bun-js-basics-course/
In this section we create a very simple server and begin to explore some of buns native functionality.

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.6. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
