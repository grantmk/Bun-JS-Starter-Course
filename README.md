# bun-js-starter-course

This is companion code for Section 2 (A Simple Bun Server - Exploring the API) to my bun JS course which you can find at: https://iamdev.net/courses/bun-js-for-devs-course/

To install dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

To run:

```bash
bun run index.ts
```

This project was created using `bun init` in bun v1.0.6. [Bun](https://bun.sh) is a fast all-in-one JavaScript runtime.
